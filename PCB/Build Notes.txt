PCB made to be assembed on Arduino shield perforated prototype board. Proper PCB is a To Do item. 
"Top" layer traces are those to add on the perf board. This is probably easier to do on the actual bottom of the board. 
The "Bottom" (blue) traces are designated for insulated jumper wires. 

Requires 1306 OLED unit:

Rotary encoder:

Pushbutton:

And some headers + resistors + basic LEDs.  Plus a power supply (5v/5A) and an ESC for the motor.  

I used this motor:

and this ESC:

Motor and ESC can be substituted with another unit, but key features are a hollow spindle, small size, and low speed. It's a good idea to measure the current draw of your motor on a bench power supply before committing to a secondary supply to drive the motor.  The current draw goes up considerably under even a small load.
